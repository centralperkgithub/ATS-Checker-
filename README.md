## 📌 Overview

Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) often filter out resumes before they reach recruiters, mainly due to keyword mismatches or formatting issues.  
This project solves that by leveraging **Google Gemini Pro** to:

- Parse resumes in real-time
- Compare them with job descriptions
- Highlight missing skills or keywords
- Provide a quick, professional candidate summary

The result is a **data-driven, LLM-assisted resume analysis tool** that benefits both recruiters and job seekers.
